Hence, it is captivating to discover how people shape the cities and the buildings they choose to erect. I first got acquainted with the architecture of Mexico City through bright facades that frequent Instagram. Yet, after a more close and deliberate encounter, it saddens me those iconic bright walls do very little to describe the ambiance of the city.</p><p>Blessed with the near-perfect climate, Mexico City buildings are a hodgepodge of proud reincarnation of the remains of Aztec, the yearning for Spanish heritage as represented by flower-studded barrack courtyards, the ingenious take on mid-century modernism and eccentric variations on contemporary architecture.</p><p>Mexitecture is my effort to compile the most interesting milestones in the architecture of Mexico City: to highlight the ‘crown jewels’ as well as to re-surface it’s ‘classics’. I hope this project will become breadcrumbs for the curious adventurers ready to discover the man-made beautiful environment of Mexico City.</p><div class="buffer"></div><h5>Made By <a href="https://annanicanorova.com/">Anna Nicanorova</a></h5><h5></h5></div></template><script>var AboutPage=/*#__PURE__*/function(_Polymer$Element){babelHelpers.inherits(AboutPage,_Polymer$Element);function AboutPage(){babelHelpers.classCallCheck(this,AboutPage);return babelHelpers.possibleConstructorReturn(this,babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(AboutPage).apply(this,arguments))}babelHelpers.createClass(AboutPage,null,[{key:"is",get:function get(){return"about-page"}}]);return AboutPage}(Polymer.Element);window.customElements.define(AboutPage.is,AboutPage);</script></dom-module>window.customElements.define(AboutPage.is, AboutPage);</body></html>
