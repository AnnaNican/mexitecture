      <p>Architecture is the manifestation of the aspirations of societies. Hence,  it is captivating to discover how people shape the cities and the buildings they choose to erect. I first got acquainted with the architecture of Mexico City through bright facades that frequent Instagram. Yet, after a more close and deliberate encounter, it saddens me those iconic bright walls do very little to describe the ambiance of the city. </p>
      <p>Blessed with the near-perfect climate, Mexico City buildings are a hodgepodge of proud reincarnation of the remains of Aztec, the yearning for Spanish heritage as represented by flower-studded barrack courtyards, the ingenious take on mid-century modernism and eccentric variations on contemporary architecture. </p>
      <p>Mexitecture is my effort to compile the most interesting milestones in the architecture of Mexico City: to highlight the ‘crown jewels’  as well as to re-surface it’s ‘classics’. I hope this project will become breadcrumbs for the curious adventurers ready to discover the man-made beautiful environment of Mexico City.</p>
